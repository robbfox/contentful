# Robb Fox's Blog Site

A personal blog site built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), integrated with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as the headless CMS. This project features a modern stack including React, Three.js for 3D elements, and Framer Motion for animations.

## Features

*   **Contentful Integration**: Easy content management.
*   **3D Visuals**: Utilizes `three.js` and `@react-three/fiber`.
*   **Animations**: Smooth transitions with `framer-motion`.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with `bulma` CSS framework.
*   **Image Optimization**: Uses Gatsby's image processing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.0.0 or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

    ```

    You can find your API keys in Contentful under: `Settings > API keys`.

    The script will create `.env.development` and `.env.production` files with your credentials.
